        "### Q&A\n",
        "The Random Forest model demonstrates good performance in predicting heart disease. Key metrics obtained from the evaluation are:\n",
        "*   **Accuracy:** 0.7541, indicating that the model correctly classified approximately 75.41% of the cases.\n",
        "*   **Precision:** 0.7500, meaning that when the model predicts heart disease, it is correct 75% of the time.\n",
        "*   **Recall:** 0.8182, showing that the model correctly identifies 81.82% of all actual heart disease cases.\n",
        "*   **F1-Score:** 0.7826, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's accuracy.\n",
        "*   **AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve):** 0.8755, suggesting a strong ability of the model to distinguish between positive and negative classes. An AUC value of 0.8755 indicates that there is an 87.55% chance that the model will distinguish between a randomly chosen positive instance and a randomly chosen negative instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The initial attempt to download the dataset using the Kaggle API failed due to \"403 Client Error: Forbidden,\" requiring a manual download and upload of the `heart-disease-uci.zip` file.\n",
        "*   The dataset contained no missing values, eliminating the need for imputation.\n",
        "*   Categorical features (`sex`, `cp`, `fbs`, `restecg`, `exang`, `slope`, `ca`, `thal`) were successfully one-hot encoded using `pd.get_dummies()` with `drop_first=True`.\n",
        "*   The data was split into training and testing sets with a 80/20 ratio, resulting in 242 samples for training and 61 samples for testing, ensuring class balance using `stratify=y`.\n",
        "*   A Random Forest Classifier was trained successfully, achieving an accuracy of 0.7541, a precision of 0.7500, a recall of 0.8182, an F1-score of 0.7826, and an AUC of 0.8755 on the test set.\n",
        "*   A confusion matrix and ROC curve were generated, visually confirming the model's performance and discrimination capability.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The model exhibits a higher recall than precision, suggesting it is better at identifying actual heart disease cases (fewer false negatives) but might have a slightly higher rate of false positives. This could be beneficial in medical diagnosis where missing a true positive can be more critical.\n",
        "*   Further investigation could involve hyperparameter tuning for the Random Forest model to potentially improve performance metrics. Additionally, exploring other advanced ensemble methods or deep learning models might yield better predictive capabilities.\n"
